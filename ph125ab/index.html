<div style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Physics 125ab<br>
Fall Quarter, 2008 and Winter Quarter, 2009<br>
Course Homepage<br>
</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<h4><a name="mozTocId230220" class="mozTocH4"></a>Overview</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The Ph125abc sequence covers quantum
mechanics
at a level of sophistication beyond the introductory Ph 2/12
sequence.&nbsp; You will see much material that is familiar to you from
these courses; but, in Ph125abc, you will truly learn to attack basic
quantum problems from scratch and arrive at
full solutions that can be tested by experiment.&nbsp; We will also
explore some of the interesting and unusual implications of quantum
mechanics.<br>
<br>
It is impossible to emphasize how important the core physics courses
Ph106 and
Ph125 are: these teach you the basic frameworks and techniques that you
must know to do any physics.<br>
<br>
Ph125ab will cover the basic techniques and results of quantum
mechanics along with a small selection of special topics.<br>
<br>
Ph125c will cover additional techniques and applications and will be
taught by
Prof. Wise.<br>

    <br>
2007/2008 lecture notes: <a href="ph125_notes_2007.pdf">pdf</a><br>
2008/2009 lecture notes (updated following each lecture, see course <a
 href="https://courses.caltech.edu/">Moodle page</a> for details): <a
 href="ph125_notes.pdf">pdf</a><br>
    <br>
My lecture notes in general follow Shankar and are primarily
intended as a distillation for my personal use.&nbsp; It will appear in
class that I am working directly from them because I am -- that's why
they're called lecture notes!&nbsp; My goals in making them available
to you
are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide clarification of points in Shankar that I thought
deserved more or alternate explanation.<br>
      </li>
      <li>To present additional explanation or material
derived from other texts; the references will be provided in the
notes.</li>
      <li>To get all the algebra down on the page, correctly, so that I
don't get bogged down on the board and so that you don't have to
transcribe everything that I write.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
I only provide the notes in electronic pdf form, available above and on
the
course <a href="https://courses.caltech.edu/">Moodle page</a>.&nbsp;
Corrected
versions will be posted there, too.&nbsp; The lectures are also broken
out separately in the syllabus on the course <a
 href="https://courses.caltech.edu">Moodle page</a>,
with individual lecture
update dates.&nbsp; I provide last year's notes above and there also.<br>
    <br>
I do <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> consider myself
responsible for providing updated copies of the lecture notes well
ahead of class time -- they are being revised as the course is being
given.&nbsp; They will be posted promptly after class.&nbsp; You are
welcome to review last year's notes ahead of time, though there will be
changes and improvements.&nbsp; I suggest
that you spend your time in class
following the lecture at a conceptual level and noting down for
yourself points or derivations that were not clear to you; when you
review the posted notes, you may find your questions
answered.&nbsp; If not, you are welcome to ask for clarification.<br>
    <br>
Of course, it is true that the lecture notes may relieve you of the
obligation of coming to lecture.&nbsp; I won't claim that there is much
said in class that is not in the notes.&nbsp; It's your choice.&nbsp;
Some students benefit from being able to receive information aurally
and to interact during that process; others prefer to read it off the
page.&nbsp; Whatever works for you.&nbsp; Grades are based only on the
written work you hand back.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
But please do not delude yourself into thinking that, because the
lecture notes are available, you can just skim through it all on
the day before a problem set or exam is due and expect to immediately
become expert.&nbsp; Learning requires time to mull over concepts in
your mind, for your subconscious to work on ideas and problems.&nbsp;
If you choose not to come to class, please be disciplined about keeping
up with the material in your own study time.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="mozTocId564601" class="mozTocH4"></a>Lecture Strategy<br>
</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I will not cover in lecture every bit
of material
you will be responsible for.&nbsp; There are some topics that are
really better covered by reading than by lecture, and some topics that
are simple enough that they are a waste of lecture time.&nbsp; I can
use the leftover time to do more examples.<br>
</div>
<h4><a name="mozTocId492841" class="mozTocH4"></a>Problem Set Policies<br>
</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The best way to learn physics is by
doing problems.&nbsp; In addition to the regular problem sets, I list <a
 href="#mozTocId616860">below</a> some links to other sources of
problems, some with solutions -- doing problems is the best way to
learn.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">All these policies are
subject to change when Prof. Wise takes over for Ph125c.</span>
<ul>
  <li>Problem sets will be posted on the course <a
 href="https://courses.caltech.edu">Moodle page</a>,
linked
to the syllabus, usually 1
week before they are due. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Due date: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tuesday 4 pm at the
box outside my office.</span>&nbsp; N<span style="font-weight: bold;">o
mercy will be granted
on the due date and time</span>.&nbsp; Remember,
we give partial credit, so the last 10 minutes of work will not make
much difference.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Electronic Submission:</span>
Electronic submission of problem sets (email or fax) is only allowed if
you obtain <span style="font-weight: bold;">prior</span> approval from
the instructor.&nbsp; Electronic submission only creates work for the
instructor and TAs because the problem set still needs to be printed
out for grading.&nbsp; Any reasonable justification will be accepted,
reasonable meaning that you will be, for some well-defined reason,
off-campus and unable to turn in the set physically.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Late policy: Problem sets will be accepted up to 1 week late at
the due date for the following week's set for
50% credit, and after that not
at all.&nbsp; You may turn in part on-time and part late.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Please note on the problem set if it is
being split this way.&nbsp; </span>You do not need to contact me or
the TAs
to turn in a problem set late at 50% credit, or to turn in part on-time
and part late.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Extensions:<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>You may take <span style="font-weight: bold;">one</span>
full-credit one-week extension per term.&nbsp; No need to contact us,
just write it on your problem set.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Otherwise, extensions will be granted for <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">good</span>
reasons -- physical or mental health issues, family emergency,
etc.&nbsp; You must contact me or one of
the TAs <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> the homework is
due and you must provide some sort of proof (e.g., note from resident
head, health center, counseling center, or Barbara Green).&nbsp; A
heavy amount of other
coursework is not
sufficient reason for an extension (though you may use your free
extension in such circumstances -- so save it until you really need
it!).<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Solution sets will be also be posted on the course <a
 href="https://courses.caltech.edu">Moodle page</a> when the homework
sets are
due (usually late the same night or the following morning).&nbsp; If
you turn in the problem set late, you may <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> look at the
solutions until you have turned in your problem set.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Graded problem sets will be available
roughly 10 days after they are
due, outside my office.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">You
should keep a copy of your homework sets so you can review them with
the solutions promptly after the set is due.</span><br>
  </li>
</ul>
In spite of my best efforts, sometimes I make mistakes in assigning
problems; perhaps not providing enough information, or giving a problem
that results in an algebra nightmare.&nbsp; I will post corrections via
the <a href="https://courses.caltech.edu">Moodle page</a> and will
also send broadcast emails to the
class.&nbsp; If you are having trouble with a problem, be
sure to check to see if a correction has been posted, and
feel free to contact me if you think a problem has errors in it or
seems overly difficult.<br>
</div>
<h4><a name="mozTocId754322" class="mozTocH4"></a>Grading<br>
</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The course grade will be one-third
homework
sets, one-third midterm, and one-third final.<br>
<br>
Collaboration is permitted on
homework sets, but each
student's
solution must be the result of his or her own understanding of the
material.&nbsp; No manual xeroxing is allowed.&nbsp; See below for some
<a href="#WorkingInGroups">comments</a> on working in groups.<br>
<br>
Use of mathematical software like Mathematica is allowed, but will not
be available for exams.&nbsp; Prof. Mabuchi made a very good point when
he taught Ph125: <span style="font-style: italic;">It is absolutely
essential that you develop a strong intuition for basic calculations
involving linear algebra, differential equations, and the like.&nbsp;
The only way to develop this intuition is by working lots of problems
by hand; skipping this phase of your education is a really bad idea.</span>&nbsp;
Be careful how you use such packages.<br>
<br>
The midterm and
final are
not collaborative, though you are welcome to consult your own notes
(both in-class and any additional notes you take), Shankar, and my
lecture notes (including typo corrections).&nbsp; You
may not use other textbooks,
the web,&nbsp; any other resources, or any software of any kind.<span

<h4><a name="UsingMoodle"></a>Using Moodle Page<br>
</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This year we are trying out Moodle,
course software used by many institutions.&nbsp; You can log on to
Moodle at <br>
<br>
<a href="https://courses.caltech.edu">https://courses.caltech.edu</a><br>
<br>
A password for the Ph125a page will be provided in class; you can also
obtain it from your classmates, the TAs, or myself.&nbsp; All course
logistics and assignments will be announced via the Moodle page.&nbsp;
You will find a listing of the course syllabus, problem sets, and
solutions there.&nbsp; There is also a weekly homework survey.&nbsp; It
would be very beneficial (to me and you) if you could fill out the
survey regularly. Especially important is the ``News Forum'', via which
I will make course announcements that I believe you will receive
automatically via email once you have logged in to the course
page.&nbsp; This is the first time Moodle is in widespread use at
Caltech, and the first time I am using it, so please bear with me as I
figure it out.<br>

<h4><a name="WorkingInGroups"></a>Comment on Working in Groups:</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
It is in general a good thing to work
with other students while reading and doing problem sets.&nbsp; You get
to hear different perspectives on the material and frequently your
peers can help you get past obstacles to understanding.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">However</span>, you must use group
work carefully.&nbsp; If you rely on your colleagues too much, or take
a very long time to do the homework sets, you will do poorly in the
fixed-time, independent exam environment.&nbsp; Empirically, we observe
that students with good exam scores tend to also have done well on
homework, but that good homework scores do not predict good exam
scores.&nbsp; Exam scores correlate from exam to exam, even on largely
independent material.&nbsp; For example, scores from 2004-2005 Ph106ab:<br>
<br>
<img src="2004/Ph106PSExamCorrelations.png" alt=""
 style="width: 600px; height: 504px;"><br>
<br>
Notice, in particular,
the midterm-final correlation for Ph106b, which is remarkable because
the
exams covered totally disjoint material (mechanics vs. E&amp;M) and
were written by two different instructors.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To avoid suffering from this problem, I have two suggestions:<br>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>Talk to your peers, in particular peers outside of your usual
workgroup, to find out how long they are spending on problem
sets.&nbsp; If you find you are spending much more time, figure out
why!&nbsp; Do you need to spend more time understanding the material
before diving in to problem sets?&nbsp; Do you jump to an incorrect
solution method too quickly?&nbsp; Are you getting bogged down in
algebra?&nbsp; Consult me or the TAs too.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>While working in groups can be helpful, you have to be careful to
remain sufficiently independent that you can solve problems on your
own!&nbsp; My suggestion is to go over the material and examples in
groups, but try to work the problems by yourself, using help from
others as a last resort.&nbsp; If you find yourself helping one of your
peers, don't just explain how to do the problem; try to help him find
his way to the solution himself.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is not just an arbitrary classroom
exercise.&nbsp; In research, one is always under schedule pressure --
because one only has a fixed number of nights at an observatory,
because there are funding deadlines, because there are competing groups
doing similar work.&nbsp; It is critical to learn how to cut through
irrelevant or unimportant information and get to results in a timely
fashion.</div>
